### Creating issues
Hi, all! This is how we should be adding issues to our github project tracker.
Let's try to stay organized!

1. **Create an issue**
    * Go to "Issues" tab 
    * Click on green button "New Issues"
    * Fill up the Title, try to make it descriptive
    * In the description, you *must* write:
        * On the first line: "This issue is related to user story #X:"
        This is to ensure the issue is linked to a user story.
        * The rest of the description should describe the issue as you see fit.
    * On the right side of the screen, you *need* to add more details.
        * **Assignees:** Assign it to whoever is responsible for this issue, it should ideally be one person. 
        *  **Labels:** You *must* assign the "subtask" label. Additionally, assign the label corresponding to the type of user story you are working on. Thus far, the options are "profile", "geolocation", "documentation", "habit", "habit events".
        *  **Projects:** assign the issue to the "Habit Tracker Project Backlog." This will add it to our to-do list.
        *  **Milestone:** if this is something you want to get done by the half-way point milestone, add it. Otherwise, it may remain empty.
2. **LINK ISSUE TO USER STORY**
    * Find the issue page for the user story X
    * In the user story issue page, Add as a checklist the ID of the issue you just created
        * This would look like:
        - [ ] #X
        - [ ]
